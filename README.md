# dxc-prototype
This repository contains the prototype of an example architecture originally developed for the HP Enterprise IROPS project
from which this repo was forked. This prototype was refactored to be a more generic DXC prototype. Additional work will be
added here to improve the prototype.

See the bootstrap section README for some initial documentation on how to bootstrap the system.
