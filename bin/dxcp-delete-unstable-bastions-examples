# Here's a list of the commands which need to be run to delete the Unstable MultiEnvironment (us-east-2 / Ohio)
# - It's very likely some of these will fail due to manual changes, requiring
#   this script to be run until a failure, stopped with manual steps to clear
#   out what's blocking the deletion, then a restart, until done.
# - This script also deletes the bastions and examples, not needed nor usually created in the
#   Stable or Training MultiEnvironments
#
